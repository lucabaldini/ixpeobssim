  in observations where the detectors are initially completely discharged
  (and to be used by default).
* Charging parameters now read from the proper file in the preudo-CALDB.
* Charging-specific command-line switches modified (note that chrgtsteps is
  now chrgtstep, and we're setting the width of the step, rather than the
  number of steps).

* Merging in pull request https://bitbucket.org/ixpesw/ixpeobssim/pull-requests/168
* Added an optional ‘side’ argument to the bisect function in hist.py, matching
  the signature of numpy.searchsorted (default is ‘left’, as in numpy.searchsorted,
  so the change is backward-compatible).
* Small change in how events are assigned to the correct gain value by the gain()
  function in charging.py, to match the fact that the the self.__gain_data attribute
  now has the dimension of its time axis increased by one, matching exactly the
  time binning of the energy flux cube.
* Implemented the slow charging process---for now its parameters are hard-coded
  to zero, so that only the fast charging is actually active. We will fully enable
  the slow charging process when charging parameters will be taken from a CALDB
  file, see
  https://github.com/lucabaldini/ixpeobssim/issues/449/set-the-parameters-for-the-charging-model

* This is mainly to allow disengaging the application of the vignetting for

* This is a massive refactoring of all the spline classes, including those
  dealing with the generation of random numbers, the two most profound changes
  being a fix of the way we handle meshgrids in bivariate splines, and a change
  in the signature of random number generators with auxiliary variables
  (rv and aux swapped). Both changes involve a subtle variation of the semantics
  but the net result is now clean and self-consistent, and the operation was
  absolutely necessary before we started implementing new complex features on
  top of our spline/rng ecosystem. (This should be all largely transparent to
  end user but, needless to say, we might have introduced side effects, so
  watch out.)
* xSourceSpectrum class added.
* As a consequence of the spline refactoring our interbale representations of
  the energy dispersion and the azimuthal response generators, as well as the
  source and count spectra, are now rotated by 90 degrees.
* Interpolation in log space now working.

     * all irfgen data files reorganized into folders matching the
       new irfgen Python modules.
