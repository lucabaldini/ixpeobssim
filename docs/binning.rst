Binned data products
====================

ixpeobssim comes with its own set of facilities for binning event lists in
several different flavors. Rather than just for the fun of reinventing the
wheel, this was intentionally done with the precise purpose of making easy for
people to develop :ref:`pipeline`.

The main interface for binning photon lists is provided by |xpbin|, while the
main visualization interface is provided by |xpbinview|.

From an architectural standpoint, each binning flavor comes with its own
interface classes for output (i.e., creating binned files from event lists)
and input (i.e., reading, visualizing and manipulating binned FITS files).
This is documented for developers in the APIs.

.. note::
   All the binned data products implemented in ixpeobssim provide an overloaded
   `__iadd__() <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__>`_
   dunder that allows to sum multiple files transparently---which is customarily
   done, e.g., over the three detector units.
   Additional methods such as subtraction `__isub__()` and multiplication by 
   a scalar `__imul__()` are implemented for polarization data cubes, maps and
   count spectra, for the purpose of rescaling (e.g.: by the livetime or backscal)
   and subtracting data (as for background subtraction).

   When manipulating binned files programmatically you can call the class
   constructor directly or, more commonly, use the ``from_file_list()`` hook,
   e.g.:

   .. code-block:: python

      from ixpeobssim.binning.polarization import xBinnedCountSpectrum

      # Load a count spectrum for a single DU
      spec = xBinnedCountSpectrum('du1.fits')

      # Load the combined count spectrum for three DUs
      spec = xBinnedCountSpectrum.from_file_list(['du1.fits', 'du2.fits', 'du3.fits'])


We emphasize that all the polarization analysis takes place in Stokes parameter
space, starting from the event-by-event Stokes parameters corrected for the
spurious modulation

.. math::
   q_i & \rightarrow \text{content of the \texttt{Q} column in level-2 files}\\
   u_i & \rightarrow \text{content of the \texttt{U} column in level-2 files}

Additionally, the polarization analysis tools are aware of the event weights

.. math::
   w_i & \rightarrow \text{content of the \texttt{W\_MOM} column in level-2 files}


.. warning::

   After the spurious modulation subtraction the event-by-event Stokes parameters
   are not properly normalized, i.e., can lie outside (and even very much outside)
   the physical [-2, 2] interval. This is generally not an issue, as the
   the spurious modulation subtractions provides the right answer `on average`
   for any reasonably large event sample.

   The basic strategy for the spurious modulation subtraction in the SOC pipeline
   is described in `this paper <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac397f>`_.

Stokes spectra
--------------

Binned Stokes spectra are the main interface to spectro-polarimetric fitting in
XSPEC, and one of the most relevant data structures in ixpeobssim.

Stokes spectra are a simple generalization of the standard pha spectra, and the
corresponding FITS files designed to store them are closely modeled on the PHA1
file definition in the
`OGIP spectral file format <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/spectra/ogip_92_007/ogip_92_007.html>`_
(in fact the spectrum corresponding to the I Stokes parameter *is* a standard
PHA1 file).

Not surprisingly---at least in the IXPE context, where we neglect circular
polarization---Stokes spectra come in three flavors:

* I, mapped to ``*pha1.fits`` files via the
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xEventBinningPHA1` class;
* Q, mapped to ``*pha1q.fits`` files via the
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xEventBinningPHA1Q` class;
* U, mapped to ``*pha1u.fits`` files via the
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xEventBinningPHA1U` class.

Accordingly, binned files in the three flavors are created by invoking |xpbin|
with the ``PHA1``, ``PHA1Q`` and ``PHA1U`` values for the ``--algorithm``
command-line switch.

The :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xBinnedCountSpectrum` is the read interface
to all of the three flavors.


Binary table definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The definition of the FITS binary tables for storing Stokes spectra is
the same for the three different incarnations

.. literalinclude:: ../ixpeobssim/binning/fmt.py
   :pyobject: xBinTableHDUPHA1

the only difference being the value of the ``XFLT0001`` keyword of the
``SPECTRUM`` extension, which needs to be properly set in order to instruct
XSPEC to apply the polarization correction---and particularly:

* ``Stokes:0`` for I spectra;
* ``Stokes:1`` for Q spectra;
* ``Stokes:2`` for U spectra.


Technical details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analytically, Stokes spectra are (possibly weighted) histograms in pulse-invariant
space where, given the definition

.. math::
   \varepsilon_k = \frac{1}{T} \frac{\sum_{\text{PI}=k} w_i}{\sum_{\text{PI}=k} w_i^2}

the content of the k-th bin is given by

.. math::
   I_k &= \displaystyle \varepsilon_k \sum_{\text{PI}=k} w_i \quad \text{and} \quad
   \sigma_{I_k} = \varepsilon_k \sqrt{\sum_{\text{PI}=k} w_i^2}\\
   Q_k &= \displaystyle \varepsilon_k \sum_{\text{PI}=k} w_i q_i \quad \text{and} \quad
   \sigma_{Q_k} = \varepsilon_k \sqrt{\sum_{\text{PI}=k} (w_i q_i)^2}\\
   U_k &= \displaystyle \varepsilon_k \sum_{\text{PI}=k} w_i u_i \quad \text{and} \quad
   \sigma_{U_k} = \varepsilon_k \sqrt{\sum_{\text{PI}=k} (w_i u_i)^2}


It is worth mentioning that for an un-weighted analysis (i.e., when the weights
are unitary for all the events) the above expressions reduce to the more familiar ones

.. math::
   \displaystyle \varepsilon_k & \xrightarrow[w_i = 1]{} \frac{1}{T}\\
   \displaystyle I_k &  \xrightarrow[w_i = 1]{} \frac{N_k}{T} \quad \text{and} \quad
   \sigma_{I_k} \xrightarrow[w_i = 1]{} \frac{\sqrt{N_k}}{T}\\
   \displaystyle Q_k & \xrightarrow[w_i = 1]{} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{\text{PI}=k} q_i
   \quad \text{and} \quad
   \sigma_{Q_k} \xrightarrow[w_i = 1]{} \frac{1}{T} \sqrt{\sum_{\text{PI}=k} q_i^2}\\
   \displaystyle U_k & \xrightarrow[w_i = 1]{} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{\text{PI}=k} u_i
   \quad \text{and} \quad
   \sigma_{U_k} \xrightarrow[w_i = 1]{} \frac{1}{T} \sqrt{\sum_{\text{PI}=k} u_i^2}.

The reader is referred to the section about the :ref:`xspec` for more details
about one would use binned Stokes spectra in a spectro-polarimetric fit using
XSPEC.


Normalized Stokes spectra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|xpbin| provides facilities to produce *normalized Stokes spectra*
(i.e., spectra where the Q and U channels are divided by the corresponding I
channels) with the ``PHA1QN`` and ``PHA1UN`` binning algorithms:

* Q/I, mapped to ``*pha1qn.fits`` files via the
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xEventBinningPHA1QN` class;
* U/I, mapped to ``*pha1un.fits`` files via the
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xEventBinningPHA1UN` class.

This can be used in purely polarimetric fits, e.g., in XSPEC, with the spectral
part of the problem completely factored out---more about this in the
section about :ref:`xspec`.


Polarization analysis
---------------------

Binned Stokes cubes are not the only binned data product that is relevant to
polarization measurement. ixpeobssim provides a series of data structures
designed to hold broadband polarization information---possibly in multiple
energy layers and sky-coordinate bins.

.. warning::
   One important point to emphasize up-front is that the formalism described in
   this section neglects *by construction* the effect of the energy dispersion
   (which is instead properly handled when fitting with XSPEC). The focus, here,
   is to provide model-independent quantities that are easy to calculate and
   visualize, rather than guaranteeing full accuracy.

   Whether that is actually important or not depends critically on the
   application. Comparing the relevant data products binned in true and
   reconstructed energy (you can toggle the ``--mc`` command-line switch to do
   just that) is a way to gauge the effect of the energy dispersion in a given,
   particular setup.


Basic formalism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the polarization analysis in ixpeobssim is based on *the*
`paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6214.pdf>`_ by Kislat et al. (2015), whose
formalism is (partially) implemented *verbatim* (well, almost---you will notice
that IXPE adopts a slightly different convention for the event-by-event Stokes
parameters, resulting in a factor of 2 popping out here and there) in the
:mod:`ixpeobssim.evt.kislat2015` Python module.

More specifically, for each event we define the three additive *reconstructed*
quantities

.. math::
   \tilde{i_i} & = \frac{w_i}{A_{\rm eff}(E_i)} \\
   \tilde{q_i} & = \frac{w_i q_i}{A_{\rm eff}(E_i)\mu(E_i)} \\
   \tilde{u_i} & = \frac{w_i u_i}{A_{\rm eff}(E_i)\mu(E_i)}

A few remarks on these basic definitions:

* the inverse of the effective area in the definition of the weights acts as
  an acceptance correction guaranteeing that the relevant quantities are
  summed (or averaged) over the input source spectrum---as opposed to the measured
  count spectrum;
* any additional (multiplicative) event-by-event weight can be easily
  incorporated into the first term (and gets automatically propagated to the
  other two);
* the effective area and modulation factor are calculated at the measured
  energy---see the warning above about the effect of the energy dispersion.

(Note the lack of treatment for the energy dispersion is a consequence of our,
largely simplistic, implementation of the full formalism described in
Kislat et al. (2015), rather than a fundamental limitation of the paper.)

That all said, the measured Stokes parameters over a generic subset  S of the
events (be that a specific energy range, or a spatial bin in sky coordinates),
is obtained by simply summing the event-by-event quantities:

.. math::
   I & = \sum_{i \in S} \tilde{i_i}\\
   Q & = \sum_{i \in S} \tilde{q_i}\\
   U & = \sum_{i \in S} \tilde{u_i}


.. warning::

   This formalism has been thoroughly tested with Monte Carlo simulation, and
   provides the right answer in the limit of large statistics (i.e., for any
   sensible polarization analysis). When the statistics is low, though,
   due to the very nature of the quantities defined above, the recovered Q and U
   Stokes parameters can lie outside the physical bounds.

   Counter-intuitive as it is, this is the same as saying that, with low statistics,
   you can have an upward fluctuation of the measured modulation and, when you
   divide by the modulation factor to recover the polarization, there is nothing
   preventing the latter from exceeding 1.

   You should be aware of the limitation of this method when dealing with small
   samples. The uncertainties on Q and U will tell you right away whether that
   is the case.


The polarization degree and angle can be recovered with the usual formulae, and
Kislat et al. (2015) provides all the facilities to propagate the statistical
uncertainties. Note that, in a weighted scheme, the error propagation requires
keeping track of the sum of the weights *squared*

.. math::
   W_2 = \sum_{i \in S} w^2_i,

and the minimum detectable polarization reads

.. math::
   \text{MDP} = \frac{4.29 \sqrt{W_2}}{\left< \mu \right> I }.

Two related, interesting quantities are the `effective number of events` and the
`fractional weight`

.. math::
   N_\text{eff} & = \frac{I^2}{W_2}\\
   f_w & = \frac{N_\text{eff}}{N}

which reduce to the actual number of counts (and to 1, respectrively), in the
un-weighted case. Incidentally, these quantities are used to build the effective
area in the weighted case.

.. warning::

   The polarization cubes, maps and map cubes are not equipped (yet) to treat
   the background, or any estimate of the background, in any specific way.


.. note::

   .. versionadded:: 25.0.0

   All the binned data structures have been largely reworked to add the necessary
   infrastructure to keep track of the errors on the Stokes parameters and the
   significance of a detection.


Polarization cubes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest possible data structure holding polarization information is
a *polarization cube*. A polarization cube is generated by |xpbin|
run with the ``--algorithm PCUBE`` command-line switch, and is stored as a
FITS binary table where the relevant metrics are calculated in energy bins.

:class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xBinnedPolarizationCube` is the basic
read interface to polarization cubes.

The following snippet from the source code should be self-explaining.

.. literalinclude:: ../ixpeobssim/binning/fmt.py
   :pyobject: xBinTableHDUPCUBE

It is worth mentioning that, while some of the columns (i.e., polarization
degree and angle, associated uncertainties and MDP) can be calculated from the
others (and, are, in fact, recalculated when polarization cubes are summed over
the three detector units) we include this redundant information in the FITS
file as a convenience.


Polarization-map cubes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Polarization-map cubes* hold the exact same information as polarization cubes,
but binned in sky-coordinates. Each column in a polarization cube maps directly
into an image extension in the corresponding polarization-map cube file.
Each image extension has three dimensions (two for the spatial binning and one
for the energy binning), and the ``EBOUNDS`` binary table holds the physical
bounds for the energy layers.

Polarization-map cubes are generated by |xpbin| run with the
``--algorithm PMAPCUBE`` command-line switch, and the main read-interface is
:class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xBinnedPolarizationMapCube`.

.. tip::
   |xpbin| provides a ``PMAP`` binning a mode that is simply
   an alias for a polarization-map cube with a single energy layer---which we
   refer to as a *polarization map*.

MDP-map cubes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*MDP-map cubes* are stripped-down versions of polarization cubes where only
the necessary information for the calculation of the minimum detectable
polarization is retained.

MDP-map cubes are generated by |xpbin| run with the ``--algorithm MDPMAPCUBE``
command-line switch, and the main read-interface is
:class:`ixpeobssim.binning.polarization.xBinnedMDPMapCube`.

.. tip::
   |xpbin| provides a ``MDPMAP`` binning a mode that is simply an alias for a
   MDP-map cube with a single energy layer---which we refer to as a *MDP map*.

Livetime-cubes
--------------

|xpbin| provides livetime map cubes in sky coordinates and off axis angle bins;
livetime-cubes are generated by |xpbin| run with the ``--algorithm LTCUBE``
command-line switch, and the main read-interface is
:class:`ixpeobssim.binning.exposure.xBinnedLivetimeCube`);

Miscellanea
-----------

|xpbin| provides additional facilities not strictly related to polarizations---namely:

* binned count maps in sky coordinates (use the ``--algorithm CMAP`` command-line
  switch for generation, read interface is
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.misc.xBinnedMap`);
* binned pulse profiles (use the ``--algorithm PP`` command-line switch for
  generation, read interface is
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.misc.xBinnedPulseProfile`);
* binned area-rate maps in detector coordinates (use the ``--algorithm ARMAP``
  command-line switch for generation, read interface is
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.misc.xBinnedAreaRateMap`);
* binned energy-flux maps in detector coordinates (use the ``--algorithm EFLUX``
  command-line switch for generation, read interface is
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.misc.xBinnedAreaEnergyFluxMap`);
* binned light curves (use the ``--algorithm LC``   command-line switch for
  generation, read interface is
  :class:`ixpeobssim.binning.misc.xBinnedLightCurve`).
