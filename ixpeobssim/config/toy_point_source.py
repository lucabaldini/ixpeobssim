"""
This is possibly the simplest interesting model that can be simulated: a
point source with a time-independent power-law spectrum and time- and
energy-independent polarization degree and angle.

The only meaningful feature of the source that can be plotted is its
energy spectrum, which is shown below.

.. image:: figures/models/toy_point_source_spectrum.png

And here is a spectral fit with XSPEC to a set of event lists created
with xpobssim and binned with xpbin:
