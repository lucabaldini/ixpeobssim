class xRadialBackgroundGenerator(xUnivariateGenerator):

    """Univariate generator sampling the radial coordinate on the detector surface
    for a background component whose radial distribution, normalized by the area,
    depends linearly on the radius.

    This was introduced in https://github.com/lucabaldini/ixpeobssim/issues/663

    The need for an instrumental background component that is not uniform in
    detector coordinates stems from the analysis of a number of observations.
    Interestingly enough, the radial slope of the background counts per unit
    area seems to be different for different observation.

    .. warning::

       While initially I was hoping to code this by sampling two independent
       random variables, within the proper bounds, on the x and y coordinates,
       it turned out that an azimuthally symmetric bivariate pdf cannot be
       expressed as the product of two independent variables on a square, and
       we had to resort to sampling r over a circle and trimming in the fiducial
       rectangle after the fact. This is hugly, as we need to guess in advance
       how much random numbers we have to throw so that we end up with enough
       counts after the trimming, but so life goes.

    This is essentially an univariate generator whose pdf is a slight generalization
    of the function f(r) = 2r (for r = 1) that one would use to throw random
    numbers uniformly distributed in a circle:

    .. math::

       p(r) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\frac{r}{h} +
       \\alpha \\left(\\frac{r}{h}\\right)^2

    The radial slope alpha repesents the fractional half-excursion of the variation
    across the size h of the fiducial rectangle. For alpha = 0 the detector
    position are distributed uniformly over the fiducial rectangle. For alpha = 2
    the radial dependence is maximal, and the density of events is zero at the
    center of the detector. For alpha = -1 (and assuming a square fiducial region)
    the pdf approaches zero at the boundary of the circle.

    Arguments
